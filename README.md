# Background  #

My name is Sabin Constantin Lungu, I am originally from Romania, I moved to the United Kingdom when I was 3 years old. I am studying a Master's in Software Engineering, my goal is to develop front-end and back-end Web Applications (Full-stack) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript as the main front-end stack and I am also in the process of learning the following front-end frameworks to build complex web applications:

**1. AngularJS**

**2. ReactJS**

As well as utilising these front-end technologies, I am also learning these back-end technologies to implement code on the server-side of my Web Application projects:

- NodeJS
